title:  "Cordova Looking Good on Android L"
---
The latest rumors say that Android L will be revealed sometime in mid-October and officially released early November. I have ran through the test suite for Cordova on the beta and I'm happy to report that things are looking good. The only issue found so far is a minor bug in the network-information plugin that reports the connection type as "unknown" when connected to the mobile network. Android L changed the connection type from "mobile" to "cellular", which is causing the issue. The bug has already been fixed in the latest development branch. So far, no other issues have been seen and hopefully it stays that way with the final build. If you do happen to run across any issues on Cordova for Android L, please file a [Jira issue](issues.apache.org/jira).
