My name is Edna Morales. I am a Software Developer at IBM working on Apache Cordova. Part of the Hokie Nation. Owner of a cute guinea pig named Neville. Tad bit obsessed with Harry Potter.

In my free time, I enjoy reading (mostly young adult books...yes make fun), watching movies, and learning about new technologies. Feel free to contact me via email or LinkedIn.
